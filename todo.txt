optimize self pointer in function object (ie non object that is vm' allocated should fit into self_object as well)
	- add OwcaValueKind into allocated object to resolve object' ambiguity?
range step
	- do we need it?
move string content into vm' allocated objects
	- every (create OwcaVM::create_string function)?
	- on call?
		- return allocated object back to user to replace original string?
	- should we use hashmap to reuse string objects?
add value creation function to OwcaVM (so int -> OwcaValue, float -> OwcaValue, string -> OwcaValue and so on)
