move string content into vm' allocated objects
	- every (create OwcaVM::create_string function)?
	- on call?
		- return allocated object back to user to replace original string?
	- should we use hashmap to reuse string objects?
add value creation function to OwcaVM (so int -> OwcaValue, float -> OwcaValue, string -> OwcaValue and so on)
use OwcaMap for global scope values passing in and out, when calling OwcaVM::execute
exceptions
OwcaVariable so user could keep OwcaValue values and not get crashed by gc.
optimize self pointer in function object (ie non object that is vm' allocated should fit into self_object as well)
	- add OwcaValueKind into allocated object to resolve object' ambiguity?
range step
	- do we need it?
